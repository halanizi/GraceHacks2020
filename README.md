Equali*tea is a C++ terminal-based game. It has several categories:
1. Vocabulary
2. History
3. Influencers

The user begins by typing ***./main*** on their command line. The welcome message will pop up, and prompt the user for their selection!
Typing **v** or **vocabulary** will que the vocabulary category, **h** or **history** for history, and **i** or **influencers** for influencers.
A question will appear on the screen, and will wait for the user's response. The program takes in the user's input and compares it to the answer using a file comparison.
If correct, the player will move on to the next question, or the question will repeat until the user gets it correct. Spelling does matter, but upper/lower case does not.
At the end of the round, the user can choose a different category or end the game.
